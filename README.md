# Quiz App

## About:

This project is a small web-app designed to present the user with a timed quiz. When the user selects to start the game, a timer begins, and the user is presented with a question. When the user selects an answer, they are moved to the next question. If they select incorrectly, additional time is deducted. At the end of the quiz, the remaining time represents the user's score, which they can save to a locally-stored scoreboard.

## How-to:

Load the app at the following URL:

Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
